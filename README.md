# Important
 I want to make it clear from the start that I am not a developer (in fact, I am the furthest thing from one) and I am the least qualified person on earth to be able to create “complicated” tools like this (by my standards).
That said, I still wanted to create something that worked and could help, which is why I am releasing this tool.
Please note that I have tried, with the help of many others, to test it as much as possible to minimize false flags and implement as much detection as possible.
That said, the tool is far from perfect, so I ask you to use it wisely and analyze the results it gives you.
That said, by my standards, I am quite satisfied with what I have managed to create.

⚙️ Interface (GUI)
- MEMORY SCAN: Automatically detects the running javaw.exe process and scans the mods currently loaded in memory.
- DISK SCAN: Allows you to manually select a specific mods folder from your disk to scan for threats.

🛠️ Features
- Dashboard: The central hub for managing scan results.
- Search & Filter: Instantly filter by Mod Name or toggle views for Unverified, Not Found, or Detected mods.
- Smart Alerts: Visual warnings (⚠) if the mods folder was modified after the game started, alerting you to potential "self-destruct" or "hide" tactics.
- Download Source: Automatically detects and displays the origin URL (e.g., CurseForge, Modrinth) for each mod.
- Mod Details: Double-click any row to open a detailed popup containing the file hash, full path, and deep analysis data.
- **USN Journal Monitoring**: Advanced filesystem tracking that detects:
  - **Deleted/Moved Mods**: Files removed or moved out of the folder appear as "MOD NOT FOUND" entries in red
  - **Modified Mods**: Files altered during runtime are highlighted in **bold orange** (both name and path)
  - **Detailed Logs**: View a complete timeline of file events (Create, Delete, Move/Rename, Modify) with precise timestamps in the Mod Details popup
  - **Smart Filtering**: Journal checks only show modifications that occurred after Minecraft started (Memory Scan) or after system boot (Disk Scan), preventing false positives from old changes
  - **Bypass Detection**: Catches the many ways to unload, remove, and modify a mod after it has been used.

🛡️ Advanced Detection Capabilities
The Dynamic Detection Engine analyzes raw bytecode directly from memory. 
I have analyzed over 800 cheat packages to calibrate the detection logic:

- Combat Modules: 157+ unique signatures for detecting KillAura, Velocity, Reach, and AutoClicker patterns.
- Structural Fingerprints: 47+ unique patterns identifying hidden "Module Managers", and known cheat architectures.
- Obfuscation Analysis: Detects heavy obfuscation (e.g., >30% single-letter classes) and flow obfuscation often used to hide illegitimate code.
- Native Injection: Flags suspicious JNI injection vectors and unauthorized native libraries (.dll/.so) hidden within JARs.

🚀 Technical Optimizations
Implemented to ensure maximum performance and stability:
- In-Memory Analysis: Uses miniz to decompress and analyze JAR files directly in RAM. This eliminates temporary files, resolves permission issues, and makes scanning 10x-50x faster.
- Parallel Scanning: Utilizes multithreading to analyze multiple mods simultaneously, scaling linearly with your CPU cores.
- Smart Caching: Implements a transient cache to provide instant results for files that haven't changed since the last scan.
